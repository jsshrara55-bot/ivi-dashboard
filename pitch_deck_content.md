## Slide 2: The Challenge Insurance Companies Face Today

Insurance companies struggle with fragmented data across multiple systems, making it nearly impossible to get a unified view of client health. The consequences are severe: 23% of corporate clients churn annually without early warning signals, costing the industry billions in lost premiums and acquisition costs.

Key pain points include:
- Siloed data across claims, call centers, and pre-authorization systems
- Reactive approach to client retention (acting only after clients leave)
- Manual reporting processes consuming 40+ hours per month
- No predictive capabilities to identify at-risk clients early

## Slide 3: Introducing the Intelligent Value Index (IVI)

The IVI Dashboard solves this by creating a single, actionable metric that combines three critical pillars of client value:

**Health Pillar (H):** Analyzes claims patterns, approval rates, and medical utilization to understand the financial health of each corporate account.

**Experience Pillar (E):** Measures customer satisfaction through call center interactions, response times, and issue resolution rates.

**Utilization Pillar (U):** Tracks service efficiency including pre-authorization usage, provider network engagement, and benefit optimization.

The weighted IVI formula produces a score from 0-100, enabling instant comparison and prioritization across your entire portfolio.

## Slide 4: Real-Time Portfolio Intelligence at Your Fingertips

The executive dashboard provides instant visibility into portfolio health with six critical KPIs updated in real-time. Filter by region, sector, or risk category to drill down into specific segments.

Current portfolio snapshot:
- 25 active corporate clients monitored
- Average IVI score of 41.4 out of 100
- 9 high-risk clients (36% of portfolio) requiring immediate attention
- Projected improvement of +10.2 points over next 12 months

Interactive visualizations include risk distribution charts, component score comparisons, and claims status breakdowns.

## Slide 5: Predictive Analytics Identifies At-Risk Clients Before They Leave

Our machine learning models analyze historical patterns to predict which clients are likely to escalate from Medium to High risk. This early warning system gives your retention team weeks or months of advance notice.

Prediction capabilities include:
- 3, 6, and 12-month risk forecasts for each client
- Confidence scores indicating prediction reliability
- Key contributing factors driving each prediction
- Recommended interventions tailored to each client's situation

Early identification enables proactive engagement, reducing churn by up to 35%.

Alert features include:
- Real-time toast notifications for critical risk escalations
- Notification bell with unread count badge
- Automated daily email summaries at your preferred time
- Complete audit trail of all alerts and actions taken
